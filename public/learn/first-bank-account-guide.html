    <h1>Your First Bank Account</h1>
    <h2>A student guide to opening and using one responsibly</h2>
    <p>Opening your first bank account is a major step toward financial independence. A bank account helps you store money safely, receive payments, and track spending. It also makes online purchases and budgeting easier. The process is simpler than many students expect, but it helps to understand what to look for.</p>

    <h2>Choose the right type of account</h2>
    <p>Most students start with a checking account for daily spending and a savings account for goals. Some banks offer student accounts with low or no fees. Look for accounts with no monthly maintenance fees and easy online access.</p>
    <p>If you are under 18, you may need a parent or guardian to open a joint account. Ask your bank for student account options.</p>

    <h2>Know the key features</h2>
    <p>A good student account includes a debit card, online banking, and mobile deposits. Check for ATM access near your school. Avoid accounts with high overdraft fees. Some banks allow you to opt out of overdraft, which prevents spending more than you have.</p>
    <p>Read the fee schedule. Even small fees can add up if you are not careful.</p>

    <h2>Set up smart habits from day one</h2>
    <p>Use your account to track spending. Check your balance regularly and review transactions each week. This prevents surprises and helps you spot errors early. Keep a small buffer in checking so you do not accidentally overdraft.</p>
    <p>If you also have a savings account, set up automatic transfers. Even $5 a week builds a habit and grows your savings over time.</p>

    <h2>Protect your account</h2>
    <p>Use a strong password and enable two‑factor authentication. Never share your login details. If you lose your debit card, report it immediately. These steps protect your money and your identity.</p>
    <p>Be careful with public Wi‑Fi when accessing your account. Use secure networks whenever possible.</p>

    <h2>Understand deposits and withdrawals</h2>
    <p>Deposits add money to your account. Withdrawals remove it. Keep track of both. If you deposit cash, save the receipt until it appears in your balance. For online transfers, double‑check amounts to avoid mistakes.</p>
    <p>The goal is to always know where your money stands, even if transactions take a day or two to post.</p>

    <h2>Why this matters for students</h2>
    <p>A bank account is not just a place to store money. It is a tool for building money skills. Learning to manage an account now prepares you for college, rent payments, and future jobs. The habits you build with your first account can last a lifetime.</p>
