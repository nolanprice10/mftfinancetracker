    <h1>Side Hustles for Students</h1>
    <h2>Earn extra money without burning out</h2>
    <p>Side hustles are small jobs or gigs that help students earn extra income outside of school. They can be flexible, low‑commitment, and a good way to build skills. The key is to choose a hustle that fits your schedule and energy level. The goal is to earn more without hurting your grades or well‑being.</p>

    <h2>What makes a good student side hustle?</h2>
    <p>A good hustle is flexible, legal, and manageable. It should have clear expectations and a safe environment. It should also match your skills or interests. If you are strong in a subject, tutoring can be a great option. If you are creative, design work or content creation might fit better.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, the hustle should not require large upfront costs. Avoid anything that asks you to pay a lot of money to “get started.”</p>

    <h2>Popular side hustles that work for students</h2>
    <h3>Tutoring</h3>
    <p>Tutoring younger students in math, writing, or science is one of the most reliable student jobs. It pays well and builds teaching skills. You can start with classmates, siblings, or local families.</p>
    <h3>Babysitting or pet sitting</h3>
    <p>These jobs are flexible and often pay cash. They are a good option if you like working with kids or animals. Ask for references and only work in safe environments.</p>
    <h3>Campus or school jobs</h3>
    <p>If you have access to campus jobs, they are often flexible around your schedule. Library or office roles can be steady and predictable.</p>
    <h3>Freelance skills</h3>
    <p>Graphic design, video editing, coding, or writing can be done on a project basis. These jobs can grow into long‑term skills and portfolio pieces.</p>

    <h2>How to manage time</h2>
    <p>The biggest risk of a side hustle is time pressure. Set a clear limit on weekly hours and protect study time. A good rule is to start with a small commitment and increase only if you can handle it. Track your time and energy. If your grades or sleep drop, scale back.</p>
    <p>Use a weekly schedule that includes school, rest, and work hours. Treat rest as non‑negotiable. A hustle is only helpful if it supports your overall goals.</p>

    <h2>Use extra income wisely</h2>
    <p>Extra income feels exciting, but it can disappear quickly if you do not plan for it. Decide ahead of time how you will use the money. For example, save 50%, spend 30%, and keep 20% for goals. Any plan is better than none.</p>
    <p>Extra income is a great way to build an emergency fund or pay for school expenses without stress.</p>

    <h2>Build skills along the way</h2>
    <p>Side hustles are not just about money. They help you build skills like communication, reliability, and problem solving. These skills matter for college applications and future jobs. Keep track of what you learn and how many hours you work. This can help with resumes and applications later.</p>

    <h2>Choose wisely and stay balanced</h2>
    <p>A side hustle should add value, not pressure. Start small, choose something safe, and track your time. When managed well, a student side hustle can improve your finances and build confidence at the same time.</p>
