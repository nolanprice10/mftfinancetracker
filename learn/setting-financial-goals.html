    <h1>Setting Financial Goals</h1>
    <h2>Turn money into a plan you can follow</h2>
    <p>Financial goals help you decide what to do with your money. Without goals, it is easy to spend on whatever feels good in the moment. With goals, you have direction. For students, goals do not need to be large. A simple, realistic goal can change how you spend and save.</p>

    <h2>Start with one clear goal</h2>
    <p>Pick something specific: a new laptop, a driver’s license fee, or an emergency fund. Define the total amount and the deadline. A goal like “save $150 by June” is clear and measurable. This clarity makes it easier to take action.</p>
    <p>Large goals are possible, but small goals are easier to reach and build confidence quickly.</p>

    <h2>Break the goal into steps</h2>
    <p>Divide your goal by the number of weeks or months until the deadline. If you need $150 in three months, that is about $12.50 per week. Small steps feel manageable and show you exactly how much to save.</p>
    <p>Breaking goals into steps also helps you track progress. You can see whether you are ahead or behind and adjust accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Connect goals to your budget</h2>
    <p>Goals only work if they are part of your budget. Create a savings line and move money into it each time you get paid. Treat it like a bill. This makes saving consistent and protects the goal from impulse spending.</p>
    <p>If your budget is tight, reduce a small category to fund your goal. For example, cut entertainment spending by $5 a week and move that into savings.</p>

    <h2>Make your goal visible</h2>
    <p>Visibility keeps you motivated. Track your progress in a chart, checklist, or app. Seeing the total grow reinforces your effort. Some students use a progress bar or a note on their wall. Any reminder works.</p>
    <p>The point is to keep your goal in your daily awareness so it guides your choices.</p>

    <h2>Adjust when life changes</h2>
    <p>Sometimes income changes or expenses pop up. If you fall behind, adjust the timeline instead of quitting. You can still reach the goal with a longer timeline or a smaller weekly amount. Consistency matters more than speed.</p>

    <h2>Why goal setting matters for students</h2>
    <p>Financial goals teach you to delay gratification and plan ahead. These skills are essential for college and adult life. When you reach a goal, you build confidence and prove to yourself that you can manage money well.</p>
    <p>Start with one goal today. The habit you build will last longer than the goal itself, and that habit is your biggest asset.</p>
