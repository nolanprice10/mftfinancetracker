    <h1>Tracking an Allowance</h1>
    <h2>Make a limited income work for you</h2>
    <p>An allowance can be a great way to learn money skills. Even a small amount teaches you to plan, prioritize, and save. The key is to track it, just like any other income. When you track your allowance, you see exactly how fast it goes and what decisions make the biggest difference.</p>

    <h2>Start with a simple weekly plan</h2>
    <p>Most allowances arrive weekly or monthly. Divide the total by the number of weeks to create a weekly spending limit. This helps you avoid spending everything at once. If you receive $40 a month, that is about $10 a week. A weekly limit is easier to manage than a monthly one.</p>

    <h2>Set a savings rule</h2>
    <p>Choose a fixed percentage to save, even if it is small. Saving $1 out of every $10 builds the habit. If you save 20%, you will reach goals faster. The exact percentage matters less than consistency.</p>
    <p>Move your savings first. When you save at the start, you are less likely to spend it later.</p>

    <h2>Track every purchase</h2>
    <p>Because allowance amounts are small, every purchase matters. Write down each expense, even a $2 snack. At the end of the week, total your spending and compare it to your limit. This quick review helps you learn and adjust.</p>
    <p>If you overspend one week, look for a small change the next week. Tracking turns mistakes into lessons.</p>

    <h2>Use categories to stay balanced</h2>
    <p>Create simple categories like snacks, entertainment, and savings. Decide how much you want to spend in each category weekly. Categories prevent one type of spending from taking over.</p>
    <p>For example, if you want to buy a game, you can reduce snack spending for a few weeks. Categories help you make trade‑offs intentionally.</p>

    <h2>Plan for bigger goals</h2>
    <p>If you want a bigger item, divide the cost by the number of weeks until you want it. That gives you a weekly savings target. This method turns big goals into small, manageable steps.</p>
    <p>Tracking your allowance makes these steps easier because you know exactly how much you can set aside.</p>

    <h2>Why allowance tracking matters</h2>
    <p>Tracking teaches you money skills with low risk. You learn how to plan, save, and make decisions. These lessons are valuable for college and adult life. An allowance is not just money. It is a training ground for financial confidence.</p>
