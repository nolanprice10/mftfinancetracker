    <h1>Avoiding Subscription Traps</h1>
    <h2>Keep recurring costs under control</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions are convenient, but they can quietly drain a student budget. A few dollars each month does not feel like much, yet multiple subscriptions add up fast. Streaming, gaming, storage, and app services can easily cost more than you expect. The first step is awareness. The second step is a plan.</p>

    <h2>List every subscription you pay for</h2>
    <p>Start by listing all recurring charges. Check your bank account for the last two months and write down each subscription. Include music, video, cloud storage, gaming services, and any app memberships. Many students discover subscriptions they forgot existed.</p>
    <p>Seeing the full list often makes it clear which services are worth keeping and which are not.</p>

    <h2>Calculate the true monthly total</h2>
    <p>Add up the monthly cost of every subscription. If some are annual, divide by 12 to get a monthly estimate. This gives you the real total. A combined cost of $30 or $40 a month may not seem large, but that is $360 to $480 a year.</p>
    <p>Knowing the total helps you decide how much you actually want to spend on subscriptions.</p>

    <h2>Use a simple rule: keep what you use weekly</h2>
    <p>A good filter is frequency. If you use a service weekly, it might be worth keeping. If you use it rarely, pause or cancel it. Many subscriptions allow you to restart at any time. This makes it easy to cycle services instead of paying year‑round.</p>
    <p>For example, you might keep one streaming service each month and rotate the others when you want to watch a specific show.</p>

    <h2>Look for student discounts and shared plans</h2>
    <p>Many services offer student pricing. Check if your school email qualifies. Family or shared plans can also reduce costs if you split them with trusted people. Just make sure you understand the rules and do not share accounts in unsafe ways.</p>

    <h2>Set a subscription budget</h2>
    <p>Create a specific budget line for subscriptions. Decide a monthly cap, such as $15 or $20. If you want to add a new service, remove one that you use less. This keeps your budget balanced and prevents subscription creep.</p>
    <p>Tracking your subscription budget also makes you more aware of how these expenses affect your savings goals.</p>

    <h2>Audit every three months</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions change over time. Set a reminder every three months to review your list. Cancel anything you do not use. This quick audit can save a lot of money without any major lifestyle change.</p>

    <h2>Why subscription control matters for students</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions are often the easiest expense to forget because they are automatic. But automatic does not mean harmless. Reducing subscriptions is one of the fastest ways to save money without sacrificing essentials. It also builds a habit of intentional spending that helps in college and beyond.</p>
