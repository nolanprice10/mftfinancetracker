    <h1>How to Review Monthly Spending</h1>
    <h2>Turn a month of data into better choices</h2>
    <p>Reviewing monthly spending helps you learn from your habits. A month is long enough to reveal patterns but short enough to adjust quickly. When you review, you see where your money went, which goals you met, and where you can improve next month.</p>

    <h2>Gather your data</h2>
    <p>Collect your transactions from your tracker, bank account, or receipts. Make sure the month is complete. Include cash spending if possible. The more accurate your data, the more useful the review will be.</p>

    <h2>Group spending by category</h2>
    <p>Sort your expenses into categories like food, transportation, school, entertainment, and subscriptions. Add up totals for each category. This makes it easy to see where you spent the most and which categories might need adjustments.</p>

    <h2>Compare to your budget</h2>
    <p>Look at each category and compare actual spending to your budget. Were you under, over, or on target? This helps you evaluate whether your budget is realistic. If a category is consistently over, adjust the budget or reduce spending in that area.</p>

    <h2>Identify one key insight</h2>
    <p>Find one pattern that stands out. Maybe food spending spiked on weekends, or subscriptions cost more than expected. Choose one insight and use it to set a small goal for the next month. Small changes are easier to maintain.</p>

    <h2>Celebrate wins</h2>
    <p>Not all reviews should focus on problems. Notice what went well. If you saved money or stayed under budget, celebrate that progress. Positive feedback makes it easier to stay motivated.</p>

    <h2>Set one improvement goal</h2>
    <p>Choose one realistic goal for the next month. For example, “Spend $10 less on snacks” or “Save $20.” A single clear goal is more effective than trying to change everything at once.</p>

    <h2>Why monthly reviews matter</h2>
    <p>Monthly reviews turn tracking into action. They help you learn, adjust, and improve. Over time, these reviews create strong money habits and more confidence. A simple monthly check‑in is one of the best tools for student financial success.</p>
