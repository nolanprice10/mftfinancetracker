    <h1>Weekend Spending Plan</h1>
    <h2>Enjoy your weekend without breaking your budget</h2>
    <p>Weekends are when many students spend the most. Social events, food, and entertainment can quickly blow a budget if you do not plan. A weekend spending plan helps you have fun while staying in control.</p>

    <h2>Set a weekend limit</h2>
    <p>Start by deciding how much you can spend from Friday to Sunday. Use your weekly budget to set a realistic limit. For example, if your weekly entertainment budget is $20, plan to spend only that amount on the weekend.</p>

    <h2>Plan activities in advance</h2>
    <p>When you plan ahead, you can choose lower‑cost activities and avoid last‑minute spending. Free campus events, game nights, and outdoor activities are great options. Knowing the plan helps you avoid impulsive purchases.</p>

    <h2>Use cash for weekend spending</h2>
    <p>Cash creates a clear boundary. Withdraw your weekend limit and use it for all weekend expenses. When it is gone, you stop spending. This simple method prevents accidental overspending.</p>

    <h2>Split costs with friends</h2>
    <p>Sharing costs makes weekends more affordable. Split a ride, share snacks, or cook a group meal instead of eating out. Social time does not have to be expensive when you plan together.</p>

    <h2>Review and adjust</h2>
    <p>After the weekend, review what you spent. If you overspent, look for a simple change next weekend. If you stayed under budget, consider moving the extra to savings. This small review turns weekend spending into a learning tool.</p>

    <h2>Why this works for students</h2>
    <p>Weekend spending is one of the easiest areas to control because it is often optional. A simple plan lets you enjoy your time while protecting your goals. Over time, these habits reduce stress and make your budget more predictable.</p>
