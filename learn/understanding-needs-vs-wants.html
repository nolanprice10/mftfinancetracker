    <h1>Understanding Needs vs Wants</h1>
    <h2>A simple decision tool for student spending</h2>
    <p>Learning the difference between needs and wants is one of the most useful money skills. It helps you make choices when your budget is tight. A need is something required for basic health, safety, or school responsibilities. A want is something that improves comfort or enjoyment but is not essential. Both can be important, but knowing the difference helps you prioritize.</p>

    <h2>Common student needs</h2>
    <p>For most students, needs include food, basic transportation, a phone plan, school supplies, and safe housing. These are expenses you must cover each month. If your budget does not cover needs, you will feel stress quickly.</p>
    <p>Needs can change based on your situation. If you rely on a laptop for school, that becomes a need. If you commute, transportation becomes a need.</p>

    <h2>Common student wants</h2>
    <p>Wants include streaming services, extra snacks, brand‑name clothes, new gadgets, and eating out frequently. These are not bad. They are part of a balanced life. The problem happens when wants crowd out needs or savings.</p>
    <p>Recognizing wants helps you decide what to cut when money is tight. You can still enjoy them, but you choose them intentionally.</p>

    <h2>How to decide in real life</h2>
    <p>Some purchases fall in the middle. For example, a phone is a need, but the newest model is a want. Shoes are a need, but luxury sneakers are a want. The difference is the level of cost, not the category itself.</p>
    <p>A simple question helps: “Will my life or school responsibilities suffer without this?” If the answer is no, it is likely a want.</p>

    <h2>Use needs vs wants in your budget</h2>
    <p>Start by listing your needs and their costs. Then decide how much is left for wants. This gives you a clear spending limit that keeps essentials covered. If money is tight, reduce wants first instead of cutting needs.</p>
    <p>Some students use a split like 70% needs and 30% wants. Others use 80/20. The exact numbers matter less than having a plan.</p>

    <h2>Why this matters for students</h2>
    <p>When you know the difference between needs and wants, you make decisions faster and with less stress. You can say no without feeling guilty because you understand your priorities. You can also say yes to a want when your budget allows it, knowing you are still on track.</p>
    <p>This skill is helpful for college and adult life. It keeps you focused on goals and protects you from impulse spending.</p>

    <h2>Practice with small choices</h2>
    <p>You do not have to make perfect decisions. Start with small purchases. Do you need a snack at school or can you bring one from home? Do you need a ride or can you walk? Each small choice trains your brain to think about priorities.</p>
    <p>Over time, the habit becomes automatic. You will spend less on impulse and more on what truly matters to you.</p>
