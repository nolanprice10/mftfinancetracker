    <h1>Budgeting for Campus Life</h1>
    <h2>Balance classes, costs, and social life</h2>
    <p>Campus life is exciting, but it comes with new costs. Students often spend on meals, transportation, social events, and supplies. Without a plan, those costs can add up quickly. A campus budget helps you enjoy the experience without constant money stress.</p>

    <h2>Start with fixed costs</h2>
    <p>Fixed costs might include housing, meal plans, and phone bills. These are your baseline expenses. List them first so you know what must be covered each month. If your housing is paid in a lump sum, break it into a monthly amount to understand the real impact.</p>

    <h2>Estimate variable costs</h2>
    <p>Variable costs are more flexible: groceries, coffee, transportation, and entertainment. Track for a week to estimate your typical spending. Then set a monthly limit for each category. This helps you avoid overspending on impulse.</p>

    <h2>Plan for campus events</h2>
    <p>Campus events, club fees, and activities can be a surprise if you do not plan. Create a small “campus life” category for events and social spending. This lets you participate without breaking your budget.</p>

    <h2>Use student discounts</h2>
    <p>Many services offer student discounts. Look for discounts on software, transportation, movies, and memberships. These small savings can add up and stretch your budget further.</p>

    <h2>Track weekly and adjust</h2>
    <p>Campus schedules change quickly. Review your spending weekly and adjust if you are off track. A quick weekly check helps you catch overspending early and make small corrections.</p>

    <h2>Save for surprises</h2>
    <p>Unexpected costs are part of campus life, from textbook price changes to unplanned trips. Set aside a small buffer each month so these surprises do not derail your budget.</p>

    <h2>Why this helps</h2>
    <p>Budgeting for campus life is not about saying no to everything. It is about knowing your limits and making choices that align with your goals. With a clear budget, you can enjoy campus life while still building healthy money habits.</p>
