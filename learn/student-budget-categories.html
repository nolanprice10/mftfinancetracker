    <h1>Student Budget Categories</h1>
    <h2>Organize money in a way that makes sense</h2>
    <p>Creating budget categories is the fastest way to turn a messy list of purchases into a clear plan. Students often spend in small, frequent bursts, which makes it hard to see where money goes. Categories solve that problem by grouping expenses into simple buckets. When you know the buckets, you can set limits, review progress, and make better decisions.</p>
    <p>The best budget categories are realistic. They reflect student life, not an ideal lifestyle. Start with a few major categories, then refine as you learn.</p>

    <h2>Core categories every student needs</h2>
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Food is usually the biggest flexible expense. Include cafeteria meals, snacks, takeout, and coffee. If you buy groceries, keep them in the same category. This makes it easy to see how much you spend on eating.</p>
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>This includes bus passes, rideshares, gas, parking, and bike maintenance. Even if you walk most days, transportation still matters for occasional trips.</p>
    <h3>School supplies</h3>
    <p>Textbooks, notebooks, lab fees, software subscriptions, and printing costs belong here. These can spike at the start of a semester, so plan for higher spending in those months.</p>
    <h3>Phone and subscriptions</h3>
    <p>Include your phone plan and any recurring subscriptions like music or streaming. Small monthly charges add up, so tracking them is essential.</p>

    <h2>Helpful optional categories</h2>
    <h3>Entertainment</h3>
    <p>Movies, games, events, and hobbies fit here. A clear entertainment category prevents impulse spending from taking over your budget.</p>
    <h3>Personal care</h3>
    <p>This includes toiletries, haircuts, and basic clothing. Keeping it separate makes it easier to plan for occasional bigger purchases.</p>
    <h3>Savings</h3>
    <p>Savings is a category even if the amount is small. Treat it like a bill you pay yourself. This keeps saving consistent and visible.</p>
    <h3>Gifts and giving</h3>
    <p>Birthdays, holidays, and small gifts are easier to manage when you plan for them. This category prevents surprise spending from breaking your budget.</p>

    <h2>How many categories is enough?</h2>
    <p>Too many categories can feel overwhelming. Aim for six to ten categories at first. As you track, you will learn which categories matter most. You can combine or split them later. For example, if food spending is high, you might split it into “cafeteria” and “snacks.”</p>
    <p>The goal is clarity, not complexity. A simple budget that you actually use is better than a perfect budget you avoid.</p>

    <h2>Set limits based on reality</h2>
    <p>Once you choose categories, set realistic limits. Look at past spending or track for one week to estimate your normal costs. Then set a limit that is slightly lower for categories you want to reduce. A budget should stretch you a little, but not so much that you ignore it.</p>
    <p>Review your totals weekly. If a category is consistently too low, increase it. If it is too high, look for ways to cut. Budgeting is a living plan.</p>

    <h2>Use categories to make decisions</h2>
    <p>Categories make trade‑offs easier. If your entertainment category is almost empty, you might choose a cheaper activity or skip a purchase. If your food category is high, you might cook at home for a week. This is how a budget becomes a daily decision tool.</p>
    <p>With clear categories, you can see progress quickly. That clarity builds confidence and helps you stay consistent. Over time, you will know exactly how to balance your money without stress.</p>
