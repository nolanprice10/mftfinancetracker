    <h1>Saving on Transportation</h1>
    <h2>Lower your commute costs as a student</h2>
    <p>Transportation is a common student expense that can grow quickly. Whether you walk, bike, take public transit, or drive, there are ways to reduce costs. Small changes can save you significant money over a school year.</p>

    <h2>Use student discounts on transit</h2>
    <p>Many transit systems offer student passes or discounted fares. Check your local bus or train service. A discounted monthly pass often costs less than buying single tickets.</p>

    <h2>Walk or bike when possible</h2>
    <p>Walking and biking are free and healthy. If your school is close enough, these options can replace short rideshares or bus trips. Even walking a few days a week reduces transportation costs.</p>

    <h2>Carpool with friends</h2>
    <p>If you drive, sharing rides can reduce gas and parking costs. Set up a carpool schedule with classmates or friends who have similar routes. This saves money and can make commuting more social.</p>

    <h2>Plan errands efficiently</h2>
    <p>Combine errands to reduce unnecessary trips. For example, buy groceries and supplies in one trip instead of multiple. This saves time and transportation costs.</p>

    <h2>Track your transportation spending</h2>
    <p>Use a tracker to log transportation expenses. This helps you see patterns and decide where to cut back. Many students are surprised by how much they spend on occasional rideshares.</p>

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>
    <p>Transportation costs may seem small, but they add up. Saving just a few dollars a week can free money for savings or school expenses. With a little planning, you can keep transportation affordable and predictable.</p>
