    <h1>How to Build an Emergency Fund</h1>
    <h2>A starter guide for students</h2>
    <p>An emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected expenses. For students, emergencies can be a broken phone, a medical copay, or a sudden school fee. Without savings, these surprises become stressful or lead to debt. A small emergency fund makes student life more stable and less anxious.</p>
    <p>You do not need a large income to start. An emergency fund is built with consistency and small steps.</p>

    <h2>Pick a starter goal</h2>
    <p>Start with a simple goal of $50 to $100. This amount is realistic for most students and still useful for common emergencies. Once you reach your starter goal, you can expand to $250 or $500 over time.</p>
    <p>Having a clear goal helps you stay motivated. It also makes the fund feel tangible rather than abstract.</p>

    <h2>Save in small, steady chunks</h2>
    <p>The best way to build an emergency fund is to save small amounts regularly. If you get paid every week, save a fixed amount like $5 or $10. If you get paid monthly, save a percentage like 10%. What matters is that you save consistently, not that you save a lot at once.</p>
    <p>Some students use the “round up” method, where they round each purchase to the next dollar and save the difference. Others save spare change or cash tips. These methods are small but powerful over time.</p>

    <h2>Keep the fund separate</h2>
    <p>Your emergency fund should be easy to access but separate from your daily spending. A separate savings account or a labeled envelope works well. Separation reduces the temptation to spend it on non‑emergencies.</p>
    <p>Label it clearly so you remember its purpose. When you see the label, you are less likely to dip into it for a random purchase.</p>

    <h2>Define what counts as an emergency</h2>
    <p>Before you build the fund, decide what qualifies as an emergency. Good examples include medical expenses, a required school fee, or a necessary repair. Not‑so‑good examples are an unplanned shopping trip or a last‑minute concert.</p>
    <p>Having rules protects the fund and keeps it available when you truly need it.</p>

    <h2>Rebuild after you use it</h2>
    <p>Using your emergency fund is not failure. It means the fund did its job. After you use it, rebuild it slowly with the same saving habit. Treat rebuilding as the next goal.</p>
    <p>This cycle trains you to handle surprises without panic. That confidence is valuable in college and beyond.</p>

    <h2>Why an emergency fund matters for students</h2>
    <p>Unexpected costs can derail a student budget quickly. With a fund, you avoid borrowing money or skipping essentials. You also feel less stressed because you know you have a buffer. This small habit can make a big difference in your ability to focus on school and your goals.</p>
    <p>Even a small fund changes your mindset. Instead of reacting, you are prepared. That preparation builds confidence and sets the foundation for larger financial goals later.</p>
