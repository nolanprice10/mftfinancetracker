    <h1>How to Read a Bank Statement</h1>
    <h2>Understand the document that tracks your money</h2>
    <p>A bank statement is a summary of all the activity in your account over a specific period, usually one month. It shows deposits, withdrawals, fees, and your ending balance. Learning to read a statement helps you understand your spending patterns and catch errors early.</p>

    <h2>Start with the basics</h2>
    <p>At the top of the statement, you will see your account information and the statement period. This tells you the dates covered. You will also see the beginning balance, which is how much money was in the account at the start of the period.</p>
    <p>The ending balance shows how much money is left after all activity is counted. The difference between the beginning and ending balance reflects how much you spent or saved during the period.</p>

    <h2>Review deposits</h2>
    <p>Deposits include paychecks, transfers, or cash deposits. Reviewing deposits helps you confirm that all incoming money was recorded correctly. If a deposit is missing, contact your bank immediately.</p>
    <p>Deposits also show your income patterns, which helps with budgeting.</p>

    <h2>Review withdrawals</h2>
    <p>Withdrawals include purchases, ATM withdrawals, and transfers. This is where most students learn about their spending habits. Look for categories that appear frequently, like food or transportation.</p>
    <p>If you see a withdrawal you do not recognize, investigate quickly. It could be a mistake or a fraudulent charge.</p>

    <h2>Check fees and charges</h2>
    <p>Statements list any fees, such as overdraft charges or account maintenance fees. If you see unexpected fees, ask your bank about them. Avoiding fees can save you a lot over time.</p>
    <p>Some banks offer fee waivers for students. If you qualify, make sure your account is set up correctly.</p>

    <h2>Use the statement to improve your budget</h2>
    <p>After reviewing the statement, total your spending by category. Use this information to adjust your budget for the next month. Statements provide an accurate view of your spending, which is more reliable than memory.</p>
    <p>Keep a copy of your statement or save a digital version. It can help with tracking, budgeting, and even proving income for applications.</p>

    <h2>Why statements matter for students</h2>
    <p>Learning to read a bank statement builds confidence and financial awareness. It helps you spot problems early, reduce fees, and understand your habits. These skills are essential for college and adult life. A few minutes each month can save you money and stress.</p>
