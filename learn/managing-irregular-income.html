    <h1>Managing Irregular Income</h1>
    <h2>A student‑friendly plan for unpredictable pay</h2>
    <p>Many students earn money in irregular ways: seasonal jobs, short‑term gigs, or hours that change each week. This makes budgeting harder because you cannot rely on a steady paycheck. The solution is to build a flexible system that uses averages, priorities, and buffers.</p>
    <p>Managing irregular income is not about perfect planning. It is about creating enough structure to make good decisions when income changes.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Calculate your average income</h2>
    <p>Look at the last two or three months and calculate your average monthly income. Add all paychecks and divide by the number of months. This average gives you a realistic baseline for budgeting.</p>
    <p>If your income is very seasonal, use a conservative estimate. Planning around the lowest typical month prevents overspending when income dips.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Build a “minimum budget”</h2>
    <p>Create a budget that covers essentials only: food, transportation, phone, and school needs. This is your minimum budget. It represents the amount you must cover every month, even in a low‑income period.</p>
    <p>When you have a higher‑income month, you can add extras or save more. When you have a low‑income month, your minimum budget keeps you safe.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Use buffers and sinking funds</h2>
    <p>A buffer is a small amount of money set aside to smooth out income changes. When you earn extra, put part of it into a buffer account. Then, when a low‑income month arrives, use the buffer to cover essentials.</p>
    <p>Sinking funds are similar, but they are for planned expenses like textbooks or travel. Setting aside a little each month prevents sudden budget shocks.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Prioritize savings</h2>
    <p>Irregular income can make saving feel impossible. The trick is to save during high‑income weeks. Even a small percentage during good weeks builds a cushion for later. If you skip saving during low weeks, that is fine. The key is to save when you can.</p>
    <p>Think of savings as part of your stability plan. It is not an optional extra. It is what helps you manage income swings.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Track weekly, not monthly</h2>
    <p>When income changes frequently, weekly tracking is more useful than monthly tracking. Review your spending each week and compare it to the money you actually received. This gives you faster feedback and helps you adjust quickly.</p>
    <p>A weekly review can be as simple as checking totals for food, transportation, and entertainment. Small adjustments each week prevent big problems later.</p>

    <h2>Why this approach works for students</h2>
    <p>Students with irregular income often feel stressed because they do not know how much they can spend. A minimum budget and a buffer create clarity. They turn an uncertain situation into a manageable one. You might not control your income, but you can control how you plan.</p>
    <p>Over time, this system builds confidence. You learn to handle fluctuations without panic, and you develop habits that will help you in any job or career.</p>
