    <h1>How to Track Expenses</h1>
    <h2>A practical guide for students</h2>
    <p>Tracking expenses is the habit of writing down every time you spend money and then reviewing those entries to see patterns. It sounds simple, but it is powerful. When you track, you stop guessing about your money. You can see where it is going, how fast it is going, and what choices matter most. This guide shows a student‑friendly way to track expenses without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Choose a simple system</h2>
    <p>Pick a method you will actually use. A notebook works, but a digital tracker is easier to total and review. You can use a spreadsheet, a finance app, or a student‑focused dashboard. What matters is that the system is easy to open and quick to update. If it takes more than a minute to log a purchase, you will skip it. Keep it simple.</p>
    <p>Create categories that match your real life: food, transportation, school supplies, subscriptions, entertainment, and savings. Avoid too many categories at first. Five to eight categories is enough. You can always refine later.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Record every transaction</h2>
    <p>For one week, record every purchase and deposit. Yes, even the small ones. Those are the easiest to forget and the ones that quietly drain your budget. Write down the amount, the date, and a short description. If you buy a snack after school, log it right away. The faster you record, the more accurate you will be.</p>
    <p>If you use cash, keep receipts or make a quick note on your phone. If you use a card, check your activity daily and log it. Some students set a reminder at night to log everything before bed. The goal is consistency, not perfection.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Review weekly</h2>
    <p>At the end of the week, total each category. This is where the learning happens. You might notice that small food purchases add up to more than you expected. You might see that rideshare costs are higher on certain days. These patterns give you options. You can set limits or choose cheaper alternatives.</p>
    <p>Write a short summary for yourself: What went well? What was surprising? What do you want to change next week? Tracking is not about guilt. It is about information that helps you improve.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Set a realistic goal</h2>
    <p>Use your weekly review to set one realistic goal. Maybe you want to save $10 a week. Maybe you want to bring lunch twice. A small goal is better than a huge one, because you will actually follow through. After a few weeks, you can make the goal bigger.</p>
    <p>Tracking helps you connect goals to reality. You can see how much you need to adjust to reach your goal, and that makes the change feel possible.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Build the habit</h2>
    <p>Habits are built with routines. Pick a daily time to update your tracker, and pick a weekly time to review it. Link this to something you already do, like checking homework or planning your week. The more consistent you are, the more useful the data becomes.</p>
    <p>If you miss a day, do not quit. Just catch up and keep going. Tracking is about long‑term progress, not perfect record keeping.</p>

    <h2>Why this works</h2>
    <p>Students who track expenses become more confident with money. They spend with intention, save more often, and feel less stress. The process turns money into a clear picture. When you can see the picture, you can choose the next step. That is the real value of expense tracking.</p>
    <p>Start today with one week. You will learn more about your money in seven days than most people learn in a year. That knowledge is a strong foundation for college, work, and adult life.</p>
