# Daily Action Card - First 100 Users

## TODAY'S FOCUS

**One question to answer:** Does this make the probability clearer or onboarding faster?

**If NO → Don't do it.**

## WEEK 1-2: BUILD CREDIBILITY

- Your karma increases

**Red Flags:**
- Comments get downvoted
- No replies
- Community feels spammy

**Adjustment:**
- More specific math

## WEEK 3-4: SOFT PROMOTION

**Goal:** 3-4 value posts, soft mention of tool

**Post Structure:**
1. Hook: Personal situation (I make $X, wanted to save $Y)
2. Math: Show calculations
3. Insight: Reality check (probability was lower than expected)
4. Action: What changed
5. Mention: "I built a calculator for this"
6. Link: At bottom only

**Success Metric:**
- Post gets 50+ upvotes
- 10+ comments
- 5+ signups from that post

**Red Flags:**
- Post gets removed (too promotional)

**Questions:**
1. "Walk me through your first 60 seconds. What did you do?"
2. "What was confusing?"

4. "What would make you come back next month?"
5. "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"

**Notes:**
- Record answers
- Don't defend design
- Ask "why?" 3 times
- Look for patterns (3+ users say same thing = real issue)

## MOTIVATION REMINDER

You're not building a company yet.  
You're testing: "Do people care about probability?"  

If yes → Keep going.  
If no → Pivot.  

**First 100 users tell you which one it is.**

**Good luck. Ship fast. Talk to users.**
