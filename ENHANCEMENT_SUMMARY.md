This is what you should showcase in your demo video:

```
1. Enter Monthly Income: $5,000
2. Enter Monthly Spending: $3,500  
3. Set Goal: $10,000 in 12 months
4. See Instant Result: "You have a 72% chance of hitting your goal"

```

That's it. Clear, simple, actionable. That's what makes MyFinanceTracker different.
